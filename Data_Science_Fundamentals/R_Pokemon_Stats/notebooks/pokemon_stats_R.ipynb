    "# Statistical Inference: Pokemon Power Creep Analysis (R)\n",
    "**Author:** Francisco Solís Pedraza  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs a rigorous inferential analysis using R to determine if there is a statistically significant \"Power Creep\" in the Pokemon franchise and to validate the relationship between HP and Attack.\n",

    "## 1. Environment Setup\n",
    "Loading the Tidyverse for data manipulation and specialized libraries for statistical testing.\n",

    "## 2. Generational Comparison (Hypothesis Testing)\n",
    "We define two eras: **Classic (Gen 1-4)** and **Modern (Gen 5-8)**. We aim to test if the mean Attack has increased significantly.\n",

    "Evaluating if Health Points (HP) can predict the Attack stat in the Classic Era.\n",

    "## 4. Model Diagnostics (The Core of R Analysis)\n",
    "A model is only as good as its assumptions. We test for Normality, Homoscedasticity, and Independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "# 1. Normality of Residuals (Lilliefors Test)\n",
    "lillie.test(residuals(model))\n",

    "plot(model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusions\n",
    "* **Power Creep:** The T-test confirms a significant difference in Attack means between eras ($p < 0.05$).\n",
    "* **Regression:** While HP is a significant predictor, the Breusch-Pagan test indicates heteroscedasticity, meaning the variance of \"Attack\" is not constant across all \"HP\" levels.\n",
    "* **Bilingual Validation:** These results match the findings in our Python implementation, reinforcing the reliability of the study."
