# Applied Computer Science & Data Science Journey

Welcome to my central academic portfolio. This monorepo consolidates my journey in **Data Science**, **Applied Mathematics**, and **Distributed Systems**, showcasing the evolution from fundamental scripts to complex engineering solutions.

> **Note:** Large-scale "Flagship Projects" (like *Statistical Analysis with R* and *Web Apps*) have been decoupled into their own repositories for better deployment and maintainability. (See "Featured Projects" below).

## Repository Structure

### Data Science Fundamentals
Foundations of data manipulation, model validation, and unstructured data extraction.
* **Titanic Wrangling:** Data cleaning and heuristic prediction modeling (Non-black-box approach).
* **Cross Validation Metrics:** Robust model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall) using K-Fold.
* **Web Scraping:** Automated extraction of unstructured news data.

### Math Foundations
Applying pure mathematical concepts through programming.
* **Calculus Visualizer:** Interactive visualization of tangent lines and derivatives.
* **Image Processing (Linear Algebra):** Image manipulation using matrix operations (SVD, filters).

### Distributed Systems & SQL
Backend architecture and data handling at scale.
* **Distributed Banking DB:** Simulation of a distributed database system handling concurrent banking transactions.

### AI & Machine Learning
Search algorithms and pattern recognition.
* **CSP Untangler:** Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver.

## Featured Standalone Projects
These projects started here but grew large enough to have their own lifecycle:

* **[Pokemon Advanced Analytics](Coming_soon):** Inferential statistical analysis (R) and Multivariate analysis (Python).
* **[Student Depression Dashboard](Coming_soon):** Interactive Web App for early detection of student depression.

## Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python 3.10+, SQL, R.
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, OpenCV, BeautifulSoup4.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Visual Studio Code.
